# 🚀 Autonomous Cloud Optimizer Using Reinforcement Learning

A self-learning Reinforcement Learning–based system that autonomously manages and optimizes cloud resources to reduce cost, maintain SLA, and improve performance.

## 📘 Overview

This project implements an AI-driven Autonomous Cloud Optimizer that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make intelligent cloud scaling and resource allocation decisions. Unlike traditional threshold-based autoscalers, this system learns continuously from real-time cloud metrics and workload patterns.

The agent observes CPU usage, memory usage, request rate, and latency, then decides whether to scale up, scale down, adjust resource limits, or keep the current configuration. A reward system guides the agent to minimize cost while maintaining service performance.

## 🌟 Key Features

Reinforcement Learning–based autoscaling

Cost-efficient & SLA-aware optimization

Real-time metrics–driven decision-making

Kubernetes or simulator-based deployment

Custom Gym environment for RL training

Prometheus integration for monitoring

## 🏗 Architecture
```
RL Agent (PPO/DQN/SAC)
        ↓ Actions
Cloud Environment (K8s / Simulator)
        ↑ Observations
Metrics Collector (Prometheus)
        ↑ Reward
Reward Engine
```
## 🧠 RL Components
State (Input to the Agent):

CPU & memory utilization

Latency (p50/p95/p99)

Request rate

Active replicas

Node resource availability

Instance cost

## Actions:

Scale replicas (+1, -1, no-op)

Adjust CPU/Memory limits

Change instance type

Reward Function (Simplified):
reward = -(sla_violation + cost) + utilization_bonus

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Stable Baselines3

Kubernetes / Minikube / Kind

Prometheus + Grafana

Docker

CloudSim or Custom RL environments
